# NetherSX2-classic
These scripts create a modified copy of AetherSX2 3668 with the NetherSX2 anti-tampering hack applied
  
It's based on NetherSX2, originally created by Anon and EZOnTheEyes, and generated by a script created by Arjoe

They aim to do the following:
* Fix the RetroAchievements Notifications
* Expose more Global settings in the App Settings to the user
* Update the GameDB, Controller Support, and the Widescreen and No-Interlace Patches
* Add additional AetherSX2/NetherSX2 spesific fixes to the GameDB
* Resign the APK to prevent Google Play Store Auto-Update from installing 3064 over it

## Prerequisites
* Windows Vista or higher
* [The Java(TM) SE Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows)

The rest comes prepackaged for your convenience

## Using these scripts
1. Run patch-apk.bat to patch your self-provided copy of the AetherSX2 3668 apk or to download a copy for you
2. Allow it to finish patching, building and signing your copy of NetherSX2-classic
3. Copy the 13930-v1.5-3668-mod[patched].apk file to your phone and install it using your File Manager

And there you go, you should now have an updated and bug fixed copy of NetherSX2-classic on your phone!
