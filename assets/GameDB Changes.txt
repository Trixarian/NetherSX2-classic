For AutoFlush compatibility, please replace autoFlush: 2 with autoFlush: 1
Also compare autoFlush: 1 behaviour in the latest GameDB with 3668's one to find instances it's still used

Notes:
======
* With Growlanser "textureInsideRT: 1" was replaced with "moveHandler". It's better to leave it in since a fix is better than no fix
* They started removing textureInsideRT from games (like Final Fantasy) due to fixes in the code. They're not present in NetherSX2's core, so it's best to leave them in or use the older settings to work around the issues it fixes
